## 🏢 Industrial Experience

### **Hyundai WIA** | *Senior Research Engineer*
**Vehicle HVAC Design Team** | *Gyeonggi-do, South Korea* | *Jan 2024 – Present*

As a lead mechanical design engineer, I specialize in the development of high-efficiency HVAC modules for next-generation electric vehicle (EV) platforms, bridging the gap between innovative concept design and mass production.

* **Kia PV5 PBV Project:** Spearheaded the mechanical design and development of HVAC modules for Kia’s first dedicated PBV (Platform Beyond Vehicle) model.
* **System Optimization:** Engineered internal cam-trajectories and reinforcement layouts to enhance structural durability and door sealing performance.
* **Thermal & NVH Performance:** Improved thermal efficiency and suppressed abnormal noises (whistle/booming) by refining door geometries and applying advanced dual-injection materials.
* **Smart-Intake System:** Developed a control system that improves the linearity of fresh/recirculation air intake and prevents ram-air intrusion during high-speed driving.
* **Global Technical Leadership:** Represented the team at the **GM TECH DAY Seminar** in Detroit (Oct 2025), presenting next-generation HVAC concepts to global engineering leadership.
