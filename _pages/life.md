### 🎾 Beyond Engineering
When I am not in the lab or the field, I focus on maintaining a healthy work-life balance through physical activity and creative exploration:

* **Sports:** I am an active **Tennis** and **Badminton** player. These sports help me maintain the physical stamina and mental focus required for long-term research projects.
* **Cinematography:** I find creative inspiration in film. Analyzing visual storytelling allows me to approach complex engineering problems with a fresh, creative perspective.
