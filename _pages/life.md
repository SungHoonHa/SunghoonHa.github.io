## 🎾 Active Lifestyle
Graduate research requires significant physical stamina and mental resilience. I am an active **Tennis** and **Badminton** player, which helps me maintain focus, relieve stress, and build collaborative energy outside the laboratory.

## 🎬 Creative Inspiration
I find immense creative inspiration in cinematography. Analyzing how directors navigate complex storytelling constraints often provides me with a fresh perspective on solving intricate engineering challenges and improving overall system design.
