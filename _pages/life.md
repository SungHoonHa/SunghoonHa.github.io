## 🏃 Beyond Engineering
When I am not in the lab or the field, I focus on maintaining a healthy work-life balance through physical activity and global exploration. These experiences provide the physical stamina and mental adaptability required for long-term engineering projects.

### **Sports**
* **Tennis & Badminton:** I am an active player of both sports. Engaging in high-intensity sports helps me maintain focus and resilience, which are essential when tackling complex research challenges.

### **Travel & Global Exploration**
I find that personal growth often happens outside the comfort zone. Navigating unfamiliar environments and diverse cultures has significantly enhanced my **adaptability** and **global perspective**—traits that I bring to every international research collaboration.
