  <h4 style="margin: 0;">a. Kia PV5 (Dedicated PBV CargoVan): Mass Production Maturation</h4>
</div>
*Focus: Field Engineering, Supplier Quality, and System Validation*

* **🏆 Global Recognition (2026 IVOTY Winner):** Contributed to the successful development of the PV5 platform, which made history as the first Korean vehicle to win the **"2026 International Van of the Year (IVOTY)"** with a unanimous vote. [[Official News]](https://www.kia.com/ie/about-kia/news-and-events/kia-pv5-wins-international-van-of-the-year/)
* **Manufacturing Maturation:** Spearheaded the transition to mass production by managing supplier-side mold structures and refining injection-molded part dimensions for zero-defect assembly.
* **Cross-functional Coordination:** Coordinated technical requirements between Procurement, Quality, and Production teams to resolve manufacturing bottlenecks.
* **Field Validation:** Conducted extensive real-car evaluations to suppress NVH (Whistle/Booming noise) and optimize thermal distribution for the commercial vehicle segment.
* **Benchmarking:** Analyzed competitor HVAC architectures to implement performance-enhancing features, achieving top-tier efficiency for the PV5 platform.


#### **b. PV7 Platform: Advanced Reliability & Kinematic Design**
*Focus: DFSS/FMEA Methodologies and Precision Engineering*

## 🚀 1. Vertically Flying Cylindrical Vehicle (VFCV): Reusable Launch Vehicle
**Capstone Design Project | Korea Aerospace University | 2023**

Designed and fabricated a 6-DOF reusable rocket prototype capable of vertical takeoff and landing. This project required a multidisciplinary approach combining structural optimization and advanced control theory.

* **Role:** Lead Systems Engineer (Hardware & Control Logic Co-development)
* **Tech Stack:** CATIA V5, MATLAB/Simulink, Python, Raspberry Pi (FCC), C++
* **Key Achievement:** Awarded **Excellence Prize** at the KAU Capstone Competition.

#### **Technical Deep-dive:**
* **Structural Innovation (CATIA):** Engineered a **Semi-monocoque** airframe using 3D-printing-optimized designs. I developed a lightweight "Skin & Bar" structure, utilizing hexagonal reinforcements to maximize load resistance while minimizing mass.
* **Thrust Vector Control (TVC):** Designed a **2-axis gimbal system** for a 90mm ducted fan, allowing for precise thrust vectoring. I integrated a fin-stabilization system to secure roll-axis control during high-speed ascent.
* **HILS & Control Validation:** Developed a **6-DOF position and posture controller** based on quaternion math to avoid gimbal lock. I validated the system through **Hardware-in-the-Loop Simulation (HILS)**, using a Raspberry Pi as the Flight Control Computer (FCC) to interface with real-time sensors (MTi-8 INS).
* **Challenge Solved:** Overcame extreme propulsion-induced heat loads by optimizing insulation layouts without exceeding the strict mass budget for the vertical landing phase.

## 🤖 2. Avatar-Kairos Project: Remote-Controlled Vehicle Conversion
**Research Internship | University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV) | 2023**

Collaborated with the Drones and Autonomous Systems Lab (DASL) to convert a standard, inoperable electric vehicle into a fully functional, remote-controlled research platform.

* **Role:** Mechanical & Systems Research Intern
* **Tech Stack:** CNC Machining, UOMO Control Units, Power System Engineering
* **Core Tasks:** Vehicle electrification, remote-link integration, and custom part manufacturing.

#### **Technical Deep-dive:**
* **Hardware Transformation:** Successfully transformed an inoperable electric golf cart into a drive-by-wire system. This involved designing and manufacturing custom mounting brackets and mechanical linkages using **CNC mills**.
* **System Debugging (UOMO/Shepherd):** Integrated Kairos Autonomi’s **UOMO control units** for remote steering and acceleration. I resolved critical signal-blinking issues in the Shepherd interface by identifying and fixing wiring disturbances after component reassembly.
* **Power System Recovery:** Diagnosed a complete battery failure in the vehicle's powertrain; successfully restored system functionality by precisely re-balancing the electrolyte levels with distilled water, saving the project significant hardware costs.
