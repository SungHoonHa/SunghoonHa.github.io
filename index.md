      During my Ph.D., I aim to develop <strong>constraint-aware</strong> modeling, optimization, and control frameworks that improve
      <strong>reliability in real deployments</strong>.
    </p>

    <p style="margin: 0 0 18px;">
      Many engineered systems perform well on average but fail during <strong>rare transients</strong> when uncertainty and hard constraints
      interact. My goal is to design methods that <strong>anticipate and prevent constraint violations</strong>, rather than reacting after failures occur.
